         <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
         <!-- ordered list of cooking steps-->
         <ol>
            <li>In large pot, bring 4 quarts salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add a few pieces of lasagna and cook, stirring gently, until tender but slightly underdone.</li> 
            <li>Scoop the pasta out of the water with a sieve, and cool it in a bowl of cold water.</li>
            <li>Cook remaining pasta.</li>
            <li>When cool enough to handle, lay the lasagna out flat on lint-free (not terry cloth) kitchen towels.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, beat the ricotta and salt and pepper to taste; set aside.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the sauce in a 9-inch-by-13-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>Place a few sheets of lasagna in the pan in a single layer, overlapping slightly.</li>
            <li>Spread evenly with about one-third of ricotta mixture and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Top with a layer of basil leaves and another of mozzarella slices. Make two more layers the same way.</li>
            <li>Top with a final layer of lasagna, sauce and remaining grated cheese.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>The lasagna can be made ahead to this point. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate several hours or overnight.</em></p> 
        <h2>Baking Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Bake lasagna for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li><em>If lasagna is browning too much, cover it loosely with foil.</em></li>
            <li>Bake 15 minutes more (longer if it has been refrigerated), or until top is browned and sauce is bubbling around edges.</li>
            <li>Let stand 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut into squares and serve.</li>
        </ol>
