            <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In large saucepan, cook the onion and garlic in the oil over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in sausage meat and break up.</li>
                <li>Add beef and salt and pepper to taste. </li>
                <li>Cook, stirring often, until meat is nicely browned and crumbly.</li>
                <li><em>Tip pan and discard fat.</em></li>
                <li>Add tomatoes and tomato puree, then add about 1/2 cup water to each can and swirl it around to rinse out the can.</li>
                <li>Add the liquid to pan, with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Partly cover pan; bring sauce to a simmer. </li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and oil has separated from the tomatoes, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
                <li>Stir in the basil and cook 5 minutes more. Serve immediately or use in making lasagna.</li>
